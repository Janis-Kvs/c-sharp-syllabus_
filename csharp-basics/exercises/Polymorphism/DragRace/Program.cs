 * Take a look at the cars in this solution.
 * 1. Extract common behaviour to an interface called Car, and use it in the all classes.
 * Which methods will be extracted with an empty body, and which can be default?
 * 2. Create two more cars of your own choice.
 * 3. As you see there is a possibility to use some kind of boost in Lexus, extract it to a new interface
          and add that behaviour in one more car.
 * 4. Create one instance of an each car and add them to list.
 * 5. Iterate over the list 10 times, in the 3rd iteration use speed boost on the car if they have one.
 * 6. Print out the car name and speed of the fastest car
