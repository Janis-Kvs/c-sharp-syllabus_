@title[What is C#]
C# is a general object-oriented programming (OOP) language for networking and Web development. 
C# is specified as a common language infrastructure (CLI) language.
In January 1999, Dutch software engineer Anders Hejlsberg formed a team to develop C# as a complement to Microsoft’s NET framework. 
Initially, C# was developed as C-Like Object Oriented Language (Cool).
The actual name was changed to avert potential trademark issues. In January 2000, NET was released as C#. 
Its NET framework promotes multiple Web technologies.

Robustness
@snapend

@ul[list-bullets-black](false)
- C# is strongly typed.
- C# supports pointers in a limited extent.
- Its automatic memory management (garbage collection) eliminates memory leaks and other problems associated with dynamic memory allocation/de-allocation.
@ulend

Note:

A C# pointer is nothing but a variable that holds the memory address of another type. But in C# pointer can only be declared to hold the memory address of value types and arrays. Unlike reference types, pointer types are not tracked by the default garbage collection mechanism. For the same reason pointers are not allowed to point to a reference type or even to a structure type which contains a reference type. We can say that pointers can point to only unmanaged types which includes all basic data types, enum types, other pointer types and structs which contain only unmanaged types.
